Homework02 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

Really nice work on everything.  You could alwasy feel free to
write more tests.  The more testing you do, the more likely you
are to uncover bugs and logic errors.  Also, at this level, the
tests are basically copy and paste, so it's easy to do.....
