# Homework 4 Notes

The work for problem 1 is contained in the Node.java file. This program creates a Node class which contains the method for in-order traversal, then creates different trees in the main method using the Node object and uses the in-order traversal method to print the corresponding traversal of the tree.  

The folding-digit hash function is contained in the HashTable.java file. This hash table implementation allows for construction of a hash table containing strings or integers. This was done so that both functions may be tested using the same program for the data structure.
