# Week 03

### Computer Architecture
* __Recall__ Von Neumann Architecture: fetch, decode, execute
* CPU: control unit + arithmetic/logic unit
* CPU, memory, and input and output all connect to the system bus (control bus + address bus + data bus)


### Memory and Memory Management
* __memory leak:__ memory is holding data that is not being used
* Java handles this automatically while in C, the programmer has to free specific places in memory
