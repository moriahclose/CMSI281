Classwork02 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

You are doing a little extra work with this, but it's VERY clear
and cleanly done.  I can see exactly what you are doing.  We can
talk if you like about a couple of ways to shorten things a bit;
don't be afraid to do web searches for ways to do things, and to
use the Java API to help you...
