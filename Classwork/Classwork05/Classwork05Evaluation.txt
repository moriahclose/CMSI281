======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

Very good work on the testing; I like the way you show the
details of the tests in the output.  Very friendly!  Also
you seem to have a good grasp of the ideas for making the
tests descriptive, and the coverage is very good!

Nice work on the toString() method!

Keep up the good work!
